# Purpose of the site
This site is for serving markdown docs of the various projects that I have completed that I found interesting enough to share.
# Test out the files
`mkdocs serve -a 0.0.0.0:5000`

# deploy
`mkdocs build`
This will create static site files in site folder which can be served from apache, nginx, etc..   
Mine is served on https://justin.albrethseng.com
